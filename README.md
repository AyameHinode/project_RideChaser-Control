#RideChaser Control

This project is a simulation of a parking lot to practice the Spring Boot framework.

To configure the run, run the PostgreSQL installation on the site:

https://www.postgresql.org/download/

In the db.tables.sql file, it is possible to find the DDLs for creating the tables allowed for the project.

The user access password must be inserted in the file properties (empty field in the repository file). Do not forget to configure the access port if postgre is configured with a different one.
